				<article>
					<p>HTML5 was formed by a bunch of rebels from the W3C who formed 
					Hypertext Application Technology Working Group,(WHATWG).HTML5 replaced XHTML which is now almost dead.
					</p>
					<p>The expected timeline for HTML5 to become a proposed recommendation is said to be 2022. This of course raised outrage from web designers.However the date is actually not important as we can start using parts of the specification as web browsers support those features.</p>

				<article>
					<h3>The design principles</h3>
						<p>These are key principles that guide the development of the HTML5 development</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Support existing content i.e no Year Zero for HTML5.</li>
							<li>Backward Compatibility</li>
							<li>Keep it simple.</li>
							<li>Don't reinvent the wheel.</li>
							<li>Pave the cowpaths i.e If it aint broke don't fix it.</li>
							<li>Priority of constituencies i.e In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementers over specifiers over theoretical purity</li>
						</ol>

			<header><h2>Chapter 3: Rich Media</h2></header>
				<article>
					<p>HTML5 fills in the holes when in comes to media since it does not require plugins as flash instead the rich media elements in HTML5 are native to the browser. We look at some of the rich media in HTML5</p>
					<h3>Canvas</h3>
						<p>The <mark>canvas</mark> element is an environment for creating dynamic images.The real power of canvas is that its contents can be updated at any moment, drawing new content based on the actions of the user. This ability to respond to user-triggered events makes it possible to create tools and games that would have previously required a plug-in technology such as Flash.</p>
					<h3>Audio</h3>
						<p>With HTML5 one can be able to embed an audio. It is very simple to do that. You can also be able to have autoplay, buffering which can all be turned on or off. How cool!
						</p>
						<h5>Audio Example with buttons</h5>
						<audio id="player" src="witchitalineman.mp3">
						</audio>
						<div>
							<button »
								onclick="document.getElementById('player').play()"> 
								Play
							</button>
							<button »
								onclick="document.getElementById('player').pause()"> 
								Pause
							</button>
							<button »
								onclick="document.getElementById('player').volume »
								+= 0.1">
								Volume Up
							</button>
							<button »
								onclick="document.getElementById('player').volume »
								-= 0.1">
								Volume Down
							</button>
		
						</div>


					<h3>Video</h3>
						<p>Similar to audio. Only differnce is the poster placeholder. This is still not very widely supported though.</p>

						<h5>Video Example</h5>
                        <video src="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4" controls width="360" height="240"></video>

			<header><h2>Chapter 4: Web Forms</h2></header>
				<p>HTML5 has migrated from from scripted to declarative solutions. This specification introduces many new form enhancements.We look at some examples of HTML5 forms.</p>

				<p><strong>Placeholders</strong> are used a when form field has no value. However some browsers do not support it yet hence need to use Javascript to check. Example: </p>
				<label for="email">Email</label>
					<input id="email" name="email" type="text" »
					placeholder="example@info.com">

				<h4>Autofocus</h4>
                <ul><li>Automatically focus one particular form field when a document is loaded. Example: </li></ul>
				<label for="status">What's happening?</label>
				<input id="status" name="status" type="text" autofocus>

				<h4>Validation</h4>
                <ul><li>Using <em>required</em> attribute to prevent form submissions if required fields has not been filled out. Example: </li></ul>
					<label for="pass">Your password (* required)</label>
					<input id="pass" name="pass" type="password" required>

					<label for="zip">Phone number</label>
					<input id="zip" name="zip" pattern="[\d]{5}(-[\d]{4})">

				<h4>Datalist</h4>
                <ul><li>The new datalist element allows you to crossbreed a regular input element with a select element by providing options to alist. Example:</li></ul>
				<label for="counties" >Counties</label>
					<input type="text" name="county" id="county" list="counties" placeholder = "Type county to search">
					<datalist id="counties">
						<option value="Murang'a">
                        <option value="Kericho">
                        <option value="Bomet">
                        <option value="Nairobi">
                        <option value="Kilifi">
                        <option value="Kitale">
                    
					</datalist>
                    <h3>Input Types</h3>
                    <ul><li>Note that not all input types in HTML5 are supported supported by all browers yet hence will fall back to displaying a regular text input.</li>
                    <li>The new input types allow browsers to display native controls suited to the expected input data, and to validate the value entered</li>
                    <li>One downside to the new input types is that they do not have default styling yet.</li>
                    <li>Examples: </li>
                    </ul>
                    <article>
        				<h4>Slider with type="range"</h4>
                            <label for="amount">How much?</label>
        					<input id="amount" name="amount" type="range">	

        				<h4>Spinners with type = "number"</h4>
        					<label for="amount">How much?</label>
        					<input id="amount" name="amount" type="number" »
        					min="5" max="20">

        				<h4>Date and time (Not yet implemented in Firefox)</h4>
        					<label for="dtstart">Start date</label>
        					<input id="dtstart" name="dtstart" type="date">
                    </article>

                            <h2>Chapter 5: Semantics</h2>
                        </header>
							<h3>Extensibiliity</h3>
                            <p>Extensibility is about adding more semantic value to elements using the class attribute. This class attribut can be used by browers if they follow the agreed conventions.</p>

                            <h3>Microformats</h3>
                            <p>Microformats are a set of conventions which are agreed upon by a community.They are used with classes to extend the HTML5 attributes. However, they are limited by design. They solve 80% of the use cases with 20% of the effort.</p>
							<ul>
                            <li><em>Mark</em> this is used to highlight a search item. For example</li>
								<p>Search results for 'unicorn'</p>
								<ol>
								<li><a href="http://clearleft.com/">
									Riding the UX <mark>unicorn</mark> across »
									the rainbow of the web.
								</a></li>
								</ol>

							<li><em>Meter</em> marks up measurements which have a scale of min and max.</li>
								<meter>9 out of 10 cats</meter>

								<meter max="10">9 cats</meter>
								<meter low="-273" high="100" min="12" max="30" »
								optimum="21" value="25">
								It's quite warm for this time of year.
								</meter>

							<li><em>Progress</em> marks up a value that is in the process of changing.
                            <p>This is 
								Your profile is <progress>60%</progress> complete.
							<progress min="0" max="100" value="60"></progress></p>
                            </li></ul>

							<h3>Structure</h3>
							<ul>
                                <li>HTML5 introduces new structural elements that includes:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>section</li>
                                        <li>header</li>
                                        <li>footer</li>
                                        <li>aside</li>
                                        <li>nav</li>
                                        <li>article</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Caution: Do not replace the new structural element without first thinking of the content.</li>
                            </ul>

						<header><h2>Chapter 6: Using HTML5 Today<h2></header>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Today, not all element in HTML5 are supported by all browsers. However, this does not hinder someone from using them</li>
                            <li>Browsers don't support default styling for most of the elemnts.</li>
                            <li>Browsers are also yet to support heading levels of HTML5’s new outline algorithm but are still available for use..</li>
                            <li>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) can be used to support assistive technology.</li>
                            <li><em>Validation </em> is a powerful tool but needs to be used wisely.</li>
                            <li>Some <em>featur detection</em> sites can be used to determine if a feature is supported by your browser.For example:</li>
                            <a>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>http://www.html5rocks.com/en/</li>
                                    <li>http://html5test.com/</li>
                                    <li>http://caniuse.com/</li>
                                </ul>
